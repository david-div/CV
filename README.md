Junior developer, looking for a chance to showcase my newfound mad skills. Having recently finished a 12 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy I am eager to immerse into the world of programming.

I started my previous career in accounts payable, progressing to accounts payable manager. From there I took on various project roles ranging from improving processes to implementing a new accounting package.




## Skills

#### Quick learner
From being in the work place and using new systems (sage, access) to using new technologies at Makers Academy. This meant learning a lot of technologies in a short space of time, a lot of the time learning whilst doing.

#### Enthusiastic about challenges
When starting Spabraks.com there was a huge backlog. Within a couple of months, I had changed and improved procedures which reduced the backlog, and increased efficiency and accuracy.

#### Team player
