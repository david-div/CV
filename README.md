Junior developer, looking for a chance to showcase my newfound mad skills. Having recently finished a 12 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy I am eager to immerse myself into the world of programming.

## Skills

#### Fast learner
 - I enjoy learning new technologies and while at Makers, I had to learn them fast. Each week was something new and having no real programming experience, I had to pickup technologies quickly, and a lot of the time learning while doing.
  - Confident I'm able to learn and implement new technologies when and if needed.

#### Problem solving
 - Logical thinker and enjoy problem solving.
 - Capable of breaking large scale problems to smaller manageable pieces.
 - Since completing Makers, I am more likely to diagram out problems to find solutions.
 
#### Communication and teamwork
 - Managing a team of up to 5 at Spabreaks.com, I had to know that my staff were doing, as well as giving them clear instruction.
 - In constant communication with hotels, keeping good client/supplier relationships.
 - Focusing on the task at hand. On our final project at Makers ([Quark](https://github.com/david-div/Quark-Text-editor)), there were times the team would tangent and go off topic. I would always bring the team back on track (in a nice way) to focus on the task at hand.
 - While programming with others at Makers, I have been told that I'm great to work with; I'm a good listener, interested in others ideas and like to understand things well (their words not mine, but all true).
