Junior developer, looking for a chance to showcase my newfound mad skills. Having recently finished a 12 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy I am eager to immerse into the world of programming.

I started my previous career in accounts payable, progressing to accounts payable manager. From there I took on various project roles ranging from improving processes to implementing a new accounting package.




## Skills

#### Fast learner
I enjoy learning new technologies and while at Makers, I had to learn them fast. Each week was something new and having no real programming experience, I had to pickup technologies quickly, and a lot of the time learning while doing. This has now given me the confidence to know that I'm able to learn and implement new technologies when and if needed.

#### Communication and teamwork
Being a manager at Spabreaks.com, communication was extremely important. Not only did I have to manage my staff on a day to day basis, but I had to deal with hotels/spas and the rest of the business. 

Teamwork was an integral part of Makers. On our final project ([Quark](https://github.com/david-div/Quark-Text-editor)), there were times the team would tangent and go off topic. I would always bring the team back on track to focus on the task at hand.

#### Problem solving
I am a logical thinker and enjoy problem solving, which is the reason I enjoy coding so much. Working in accounts previously, the tool of choice was excel, which I became very proficient at.
